# MatrinatorV2
I wanted to redo my old Matrinator project, to hopefully be more useful and versatile this time >:3

The idea is to have a program that can:
- [x] Store arbitrary size and data type matrices, efficiently and with garbage disposal.
- [x] Be able to get and set specific items of the matrix.
- [x] Be able to add and subtract matrices.
- [x] Be able to multiply by scalars and other matrices.
- [x] Be able to take the determinant of square matrices.
- [x] Be able to calculate the rank of a matrix.
- [x] Be able to take the inverse of square matrices.
- [ ] Do all these things efficiently enough.
